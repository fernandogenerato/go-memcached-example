**Memcached Example in Golang**

This is a simple Golang program demonstrating how to interact with a Memcached server using the `github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache` package.

### Prerequisites

Before running this example, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You also need to have a Memcached server running. You can set up a Memcached server using Docker with the following command:

```bash
docker run --name my-memcache -p 11211:11211 -d memcached memcached -m 64
```

### Installation

To use this example, you need to have Go installed. You can then install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/memcached-golang-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd memcached-golang-example
   ```

3. Run the example:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

### Explanation

This program demonstrates basic interactions with a Memcached server:

- Setting a key-value pair (`"foo": "my value"`) using `mc.Set()`.
- Retrieving the value for the key `"foo"` using `mc.Get()`.
- Deleting the key `"foo"` using `mc.Delete()`.
